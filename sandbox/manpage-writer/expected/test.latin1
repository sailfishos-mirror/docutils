       This is a line block.  It ends with a blank line.
         Each new line begins with a vertical bar ("|").
         Line breaks and initial indents are preserved.
       Continuation lines are wrapped portions of long lines;
       they begin with a space in place of the vertical bar.
         The left edge of a continuation line need not be aligned with
         the left edge of the text above it.

       This is a second line block.

       Blank lines are permitted internally, but they must begin with a "|".
