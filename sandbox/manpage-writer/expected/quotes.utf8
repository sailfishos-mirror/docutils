        -  a  problem  with double quotes not being rendered in the term of an
       rst definition list in the mpv documentation:

       because the doublequotes make [1mFilename: ${filename} [22mone argument to the
       [1m.B [22mbold macro.

       [1mi show-text "Filename: ${filename}"[0m
              shows the filename of the current file when pressing the [1mi [22mkey

                                                                            ()
