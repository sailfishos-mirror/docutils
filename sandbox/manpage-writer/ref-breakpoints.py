#  Hyperlink macros
#      Man  page  cross references like ls(1) are best presented with .MR.  Text may be
#      hyperlinked to email addresses with .MT/.ME or other URIs with .UR/.UE.   Hyper‐
#      linked  text  is  supported  on  HTML and terminal output devices; terminals and
#      pager programs must support ECMA-48 OSC  8  escape  sequences  (see  grotty(1)).
#      When  device support is unavailable or disabled with the U register (see section
#      “Options” below), .MT and .UR URIs are rendered between angle brackets after the
#      linked text.
#
#      .MT, .ME, .UR, and .UE are GNU extensions not defined on systems  running  AT&T,
#      Plan 9, or Solaris troff; see an-ext.tmac in section “Files” below.  Plan 9 from
#      User Space's troff implements .MR.
#
#      The arguments to .MR, .MT, and .UR should be prepared for typesetting since they
#      can appear in the output.  Use special character escape sequences to encode Uni‐
#      code  basic  Latin  characters  where  necessary, particularly the hyphen-minus.
#      (See section “Portability” below.)  URIs can be lengthy; rendering them can  re‐
#      sult  in jarring adjustment or variations in line length, or troff warnings when
#      a hyperlink is longer than an output  line.   The  application  of  non-printing
#      break point escape sequences \: after each slash (or series thereof), and before
#      each  dot  (or  series  thereof)  is recommended as a rule of thumb.  The former
#      practice avoids forcing a trailing slash in a URI onto a separate  output  line,
#      and  the  latter  helps the reader to avoid mistakenly interpreting a dot at the
#      end of a line as a period (or multiple dots as an ellipsis).  Thus,
#             .UR http://\:example\:.com/\:fb8afcfbaebc74e\:.cc
#      has several potential break points in the  URI  shown.   Consider  adding  break
#      points  before  or after at signs in email addresses, and question marks, amper‐
#      sands, and number signs in HTTP(S) URIs.  The formatter removes  \:  escape  se‐
#      quences  from  hyperlinks  when supplying device control commands to output dri‐
#      vers.
