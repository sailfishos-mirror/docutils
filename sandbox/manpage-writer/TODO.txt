* How to typeset command/manpage names in text.

  There are conflicting traditions and conventions on these points.
  groff_man_style(7) has recommendations.

              Use bold for literal portions of syntax synopses, for
              command‐line options in running text, and for literals
              that are major topics of the subject under discussion; for
              example, this page uses bold for macro, string, and
              register names.  In an .EX/.EE example of interactive I/O
              (such as a shell session), set only user input in bold.

              Use italics for file and path names, for environment
              variables, for C data types, for enumeration or
              preprocessor constants in C, for variant (user‐
              replaceable) portions of syntax synopses, for the first
              occurrence (only) of a technical concept being introduced,
              for names of journals and of literary works longer than an
              article, and anywhere a parameter requiring replacement by
              the user is encountered.  An exception involves variant
              text in a context already typeset in italics, such as file
              or path names with replaceable components; in such cases,
              follow the convention of mathematical typography: set the
              file or path name in italics as usual but use roman for
              the variant part (see .IR and .RI below), and italics
              again in running roman text when referring to the variant
              material.

  Plan 9 from User Space troff and groff 1.23.0 support an ``MR`` macro
  for the specific purpose of setting man page cross references.  It is
  reasonable to assume that groff 1.23.0 has not propagated yet to every
  platform Python docutils would like to support yet.  You can wait
  until it has, or supply a fallback definition in the man(7) documents
  you generate. ::

   .\" Define fallback for groff 1.23's MR macro if the system lacks it.
   .nr df 0 \" do fallback?
   .if !\n(.f           .nr df 1 \" mandoc
   .if  \n(.g .if !d MR .nr df 1 \" older groff
   .if !\n(.g           .nr df 1 \" non-groff *roff
   .if \n(df \{\
   .de MR
   .ie \\n(.$=1 \
   .I \%\\$1
   .el \
   .IR \%\\$1 (\\$2)\\$3

so the MR things need to be found with regexp or marked with a role/directive ?
or a reference type man:tbl(1) 

The ``\%`` is :

  a  word  may be broken at hyphens, at ``\%`` or ``\:`` escape sequences

whatfore at the word start ?

   Hyperlink macros
       Man  page  cross references like ls(1) are best presented with .MR.  Text may be
       hyperlinked to email addresses with .MT/.ME or other URIs with .UR/.UE.   Hyper‐
       linked  text  is  supported  on  HTML and terminal output devices; terminals and
       pager programs must support ECMA-48 OSC  8  escape  sequences  (see  grotty(1)).
       When  device support is unavailable or disabled with the U register (see section
       “Options” below), .MT and .UR URIs are rendered between angle brackets after the
       linked text.

       .MT, .ME, .UR, and .UE are GNU extensions not defined on systems  running  AT&T,
       Plan 9, or Solaris troff; see an-ext.tmac in section “Files” below.  Plan 9 from
       User Space's troff implements .MR.

       The arguments to .MR, .MT, and .UR should be prepared for typesetting since they
       can appear in the output.  Use special character escape sequences to encode Uni‐
       code  basic  Latin  characters  where  necessary, particularly the hyphen-minus.
       (See section “Portability” below.)  URIs can be lengthy; rendering them can  re‐
       sult  in jarring adjustment or variations in line length, or troff warnings when
       a hyperlink is longer than an output  line.   The  application  of  non-printing
       break point escape sequences \: after each slash (or series thereof), and before
       each  dot  (or  series  thereof)  is recommended as a rule of thumb.  The former
       practice avoids forcing a trailing slash in a URI onto a separate  output  line,
       and  the  latter  helps the reader to avoid mistakenly interpreting a dot at the
       end of a line as a period (or multiple dots as an ellipsis).  Thus,
              .UR http://\:example\:.com/\:fb8afcfbaebc74e\:.cc
       has several potential break points in the  URI  shown.   Consider  adding  break
       points  before  or after at signs in email addresses, and question marks, amper‐
       sands, and number signs in HTTP(S) URIs.  The formatter removes  \:  escape  se‐
       quences  from  hyperlinks  when supplying device control commands to output dri‐
       vers.


Used macros ... to be completed
-------------------------------

       .TP [indentation]
              Set  a  paragraph  with a leading tag, and the remainder of the paragraph
              indented.  A one-line input trap is planted; text on the next line, which
              can be formatted with a macro, becomes the tag, which is  placed  at  the
              current  left  margin.   The  tag  can be extended with the \c escape se‐
              quence.  Subsequent text is indented by indentation, if specified, and by
              the amount of the IN register otherwise.  If the tag is not  as  wide  as
              the indentation, the paragraph starts on the same line as the tag, at the
              applicable indentation, and continues on the following lines.  Otherwise,
              the  descriptive  part  of the paragraph begins on the line following the
              tag.

       .TQ    Set an additional tag for a paragraph tagged with .TP.  An input trap  is
              planted as with .TP.

              This  macro  is  a  GNU  extension  not  defined on systems running AT&T,
              Plan 9, or Solaris troff; see an-ext.tmac in section “Files” below.



Notes
-----

* Images and equations are discouraged.

* Lists in admonitions are not intended.

Discussions
-----------

* Encoding declaration ``'\" t -*- coding: ISO-8859-1 -*-``
  in first line.

  The part after ``t`` is a GNU Emacs convention.  A *groff* program
  called *preconv*\(1) understands it, but GNU *troff*\(1) itself does
  not.

  The ``t`` is part of a *man*\(1) convention; GNU *troff*\(1) doesn't
  understand it, either (but since *tbl*\(1) is a *roff* preprocessor,
  it's too late by the time ``troff`` sees the input anyway).

* BUT if UTF-8 is declared tables are no longer processed.

* BUT we have a comment there and the macros following it

* Input and output encoding are problematic at least.

* escape double quotes in macro arguments ?

  Use the special character escape sequence ``\(dq``.
  groff_man_style(7) explains.

       \(dq   Basic Latin quotation mark (double quote).  Use in macro
              calls to prevent ‘"” from being interpreted as beginning a
              quoted argument, or simply for readability.

* How to write long syntax lines.

  groff_man_style(7) explains.::

       \newline
              Join the next input line to the current one.  Except for
              the update of the input line counter (used for diagnostic
              messages and related purposes), a series of lines ending
              in backslash‐newline appears to groff as a single input
              line.  Use this escape sequence to split excessively long
              input lines for document maintenance.

* Line ends around email or web addresses in texts.

  The ``UE`` and ``ME`` macros accept an argument, which is appended to
  the link text without intervening space.

  groff_man_style(7) explains.

       \c     End a text line without inserting space or attempting a
              break.  Normally, if filling is enabled, the end of a text
              line is treated like a space; an output line may be broken
              there (if not, an adjustable space is inserted); if
              filling is disabled, the line will be broken there, as in
              .EX/.EE examples.  The next line is interpreted as usual
              and can include a macro call (contrast with \newline).  \c
              is useful when three font styles are needed in a single
              word, as in a command synopsis.

                     .RB [ \-\-stylesheet=\c
                     .IR name ]

              It also helps when changing font styles in .EX/.EE
              examples, since they are not filled.

                     .EX
                     $ \c
                     .B groff \-T utf8 \-Z \c
                     .I file \c
                     .B | grotty \-i
                     .EE
