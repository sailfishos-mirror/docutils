man 7 man 
=========

tells on   *Hypertext link macros*

       .UR url
              Insert a hypertext link to the URI (URL) url, with all  text  up  to  the
              following .UE macro as the link text.

       .UE    [trailer]  Terminate  the  link text of the preceding .UR macro, with the
              optional trailer (if present, usually a closing parenthesis  and/or  
              end‚Äêof‚Äêsentence  punctuation) immediately following.  For non‚ÄêHTML output
              devices (e.g., man -Tutf8), the link text is followed by the URL in angle
              brackets;  if  there  is no link text, the URL is printed as its own link
              text, surrounded by angle brackets.  (Angle brackets may not be available
              on all output devices.)  For the HTML output device, the link text is 
              hyperlinked to the URL; if there is no link text, the URL is printed as 
              its own link text.

man 1 man states ::

       -t, --troff
              Use  groff  -mandoc  to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is
              not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This option is used to change groff (or possibly troff‚Äôs)  output  to  be
              suitable  for  a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples
              (provided with Groff‚Äê1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.



examples
========

URUE.man ::

  go to the
  .UR http://www.python.org
  python home page
  .UE
  to read

  or read
  .UR http://www.python.org
  .UE

man
---

``man ./URUE.man`` renders::

  go to the python home page to read

  or read

Specifying the device with ``man -Thtml ./URUE.man``
html, utf8 and ps also do not contain an url.

mandoc
------

txt and html work, ps looses the second url if it is the last thing in the file.

``mandoc ./URUE.man`` renders::

  ()                                                                        ()

  go to the python home page <http://www.python.org> to read

  or read <http://www.python.org>

                                                                            ()
``mandoc -Tps ./URUE.man | ps2txt`` produces::

  ()                                         ()
  go to the python home page <http://www.python.org> to read
                                             ()

nroff
-----

``nroff -man ./URUE.man`` to the console produces::

  go to the python home page to read

  or read http://www.python.org

``nroff -man ./URUE.man > URUE.nroff`` gives::


  go to the ]8;;http://www.python.org\python home page]8;;\ to read

  or read ]8;;http://www.python.org\http://www.python.org]8;;\

the string following the first escape sequence is overwritten by the second ...
might be the implementation of *bold*.
