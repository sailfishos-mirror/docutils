man 7 man

tells on   *Hypertext link macros*

       .UR url
              Insert a hypertext link to the URI (URL) url, with all  text  up  to  the
              following .UE macro as the link text.

       .UE    [trailer]  Terminate  the  link text of the preceding .UR macro, with the
              optional trailer (if present, usually a closing parenthesis  and/or  
              end‐of‐sentence  punctuation) immediately following.  For non‐HTML output
              devices (e.g., man -Tutf8), the link text is followed by the URL in angle
              brackets;  if  there  is no link text, the URL is printed as its own link
              text, surrounded by angle brackets.  (Angle brackets may not be available
              on all output devices.)  For the HTML output device, the link text is 
              hyperlinked to the URL; if there is no link text, the URL is printed as 
              its own link text.
